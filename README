Compilation notes:
	gcc is generally required(Intel's compiler might work, and newish versions of LLVM clang do work), and the compilers optionally
	specified via CC and CXX must be the same version.

	With gcc, 4.9.2 or newer is required.

	Reportedly, passing:	--build=x86_64-apple-darwin`uname -r`
	to the configure script is necessary for building on Mac OS X to work properly.



Some notes(and reminders) on the source code:

	The following system headers are included by including "mednafen.h", and always will be, so don't include them manually.
		assert.h	(included in "types.h")
		inttypes.h	(included in "types.h")
		stdlib.h
		stdio.h
		string.h

	Avoid %= in save state load variable sanitizing code unless the variable is unsigned.

	memcpy()/memmove()/etc. with NULL pointers is undefined and bad even when length is 0.

	Careful to not do something like: void somefunc(int something[16]); [...] sizeof(something)

	Try to avoid writing new code that violates strict overflow(even though we compile with -fwrapv), especially be mindful
	of stuff like what's described at http://kqueue.org/blog/2013/09/17/cltq/

	Order of operations != Operator precedence.  Remember sequence point rules, and don't do stuff like:
		value = FuncWithSideEffects() | (FuncWithSideEffects() << 8);	// BAD BAD
	See: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/eval_order

	Avoid writing new code that shifts left signed integers or negative values to avoid technically undefined behavior; use
	ugly typecasting, or multiply by powers of 2 instead(remotely modern compilers can optimize it to a shift internally).
