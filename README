------------------
Compilation Notes:
------------------
	gcc or LLVM clang is required for compiling Mednafen.  Intel's C compiler may work, but is untested.
	Probably doesn't need to be said, but the compilers optionally specified via CC and CXX *must* be the same version.

	clang: 3.5.0 or newer is required, though gcc 4.9.x is preferable for performance reasons.

	gcc: 4.8(4.8.4+), or 4.9(4.9.2+) or newer is required.  gcc 4.9 is recommended; gcc 5.x and gcc 6.x tend to produce
	slower executables, at least with Mednafen on x86_64.

	Reportedly, passing:	--build=x86_64-apple-darwin`uname -r`
	to the configure script is necessary for building on Mac OS X to work properly.



---------------------------------------------
Some notes(and reminders) on the source code:
---------------------------------------------
	The following system headers are included by including "mednafen.h", and always will be, so don't include them manually.
		assert.h	(included in "types.h")
		inttypes.h	(included in "types.h")
		stdlib.h
		stdio.h
		string.h

	Avoid %= in save state load variable sanitizing code unless the variable is unsigned.

	malloc(), realloc(), calloc()'ing 0 bytes of memory may return a NULL pointer.

	memcpy()/memmove()/etc. with NULL pointers is undefined and bad even when length is 0.

	Careful to not do something like: void somefunc(int something[16]); [...] sizeof(something)

	Try to avoid writing new code that violates strict overflow(even though we compile with -fwrapv), especially be mindful
	of stuff like what's described at http://kqueue.org/blog/2013/09/17/cltq/

	Order of operations != Operator precedence.  Remember sequence point rules, and don't do stuff like:
		value = FuncWithSideEffects() | (FuncWithSideEffects() << 8);	// BAD BAD
	See: http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/eval_order

	Avoid writing new code that shifts left signed integers or negative values to avoid technically undefined behavior; use
	ugly typecasting, or multiply by powers of 2 instead(remotely modern compilers can optimize it to a shift internally).

	Vanishing temporaries: https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Temporaries.html#Temporaries

	Do not place a period before the field width for "s" and "[" conversion specifiers in *scanf() format strings; perhaps a bad
	habit picked up long ago from working with a buggy libc or trio?

	Avoid compiling different C++ files with different compiler flags in regards to instruction set used(like -mmmx, -msse, -mfpmath, -march),
	or else there may be (template-)function ODR violations that could cause compatibility problems.

	GPLv3-incompatible code:
		WonderSwan emulation code from Cygne.
		QuickLZ(old version used)
